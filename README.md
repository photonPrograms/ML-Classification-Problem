# ML-Classification-Problem
A Simple Two Class Classification Problem with Logistic Regression

Read the training set from a json file -> run logistic regression with gradient descent -> plot the cost function versus numer of iterations to see if improvements are required -> plot the training set along with the boundary obtained -> predict classes based on the obtained parameters.
